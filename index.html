        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          According to Pew Research, 96% of adults between 18-29 occasionally
          consult reviews before making a purchase. But does this mean that
          higher ratings result in more product sales? Specifically, what do
          higher ratings indicate for video game sales? Maybe higher ratings
          lead to more game sales. But could some more obscure games with a
          dedicated group of followers receive higher ratings than popular games
          with significant sales volume? I am also curious whether there has
          been an increase in the production of games in recent years and, if
          so, what effect this increase has on the quality of games based on
          review scores. Is it possible that an increase in the number of games
          results in review scores decreasing with the oversaturation of video
          game releases? In this project, I plan to use Metacritic’s user and
          critic review scores to see if there is a correlation between the
          scores of a game and its overall sales. I will be joining the review
          data with sales data obtained from VGChartz.

        <h2>2. Data</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Review Scores</h3>
        <p>
          I collected data from Metacritic, which contained user (user score)
          and critic (meta score) review scores for each game. Metacritic’s data
          was found on 186 different web pages. I wrote a web crawling script to
          collect all data across these 186 pages. I collected the game title,
          summary, platform, user score, meta score, and release date for 18,526
          games.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Sales Data</h3>
        <p>
          The website VGChartz provides sales data about the number of units of
          each game/platform combination sold. The information was contained in
          1,249 web pages. Due to the extensive nature of the data, I decided to
          break the web crawling results into six different CSV files
          (VGChartz_0 – 5.csv), all contained in the project folder.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Merging the Datasets</h3>
        <p>
          Since both data sets included the same game title multiple times based
          on the platform, I had to merge based on both the game title and
          platform. Both data sets are also vastly different in the number of
          observations.

        <h2>3. Analysis</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Video Game Ratings and Sales</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to find out whether games with higher reviews sell more and
          navigate the relationship between the different types of sales and
          review scores. I started by calculating correlation coefficients to
          explore the relationship between variables. There was a correlation
          coefficient of 0.954 between the total sales and North American sales,
          showing an extremely strong correlation. However, the correlation
          between sales and review scores was much weaker. The correlation
          coefficient between total sales and meta score was 0.248, and it was
          only 0.102 between total sales and user score.
        </p>

        <p>
          I initially thought this weak correlation might be due to the
          difference in rating scales between critics and users. However, after
          analyzing a boxplot of the two scores, I found that while there are
          slight differences in the interquartile range, the medians of the two
          variables are the same. The meta scores tend to have higher counts of
          positive reviews, while user scores have a greater number of low
          ratings. This pattern may explain why the meta score has a slightly
          better correlation with sales than the user score.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Video Game Publishers</h3>
        <p>
          To find out which video game publishers have the highest sales, I
          created a summary data frame, `publisher_df`, which was grouped by the
          publisher. In this data frame, I included the ratings’ average, the
          sum of sales, and the number of games each publisher has released. I
          then sorted the data frame to find the top publishers in terms of
          sales.
        </p>

        <p>
          Interestingly, all but one publisher in the top ten list released at
          least 800 games. The correlation coefficient between the total sales
          and the number of games a publisher has released was 0.715,
          demonstrating a strong correlation. However, the correlation between
          the number of games released and the publisher’s average meta score
          was -0.013, indicating no relationship between the number of games
          released and the quality of those games.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Release Date</h3>
        <p>
          I analyzed how sales, the number of games released, and review scores
          have changed over time. The correlation coefficient between the
          release date and the number of games released was 0.533, showing some
          correlation, but not a particularly strong one. A notable peak in game
          releases occurred around 2010, but sales remained relatively stable
          throughout this period.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, I examined whether review scores have changed over time.
          The analysis showed that meta scores declined sharply around 2000 but
          started increasing again around 2010. Meanwhile, user scores continued
          to decline. The correlation coefficient between meta score and release
          date was -0.325, whereas user score had a stronger negative
          correlation of -0.837 with the release date. This suggests that user
          review scores have declined significantly over time.
