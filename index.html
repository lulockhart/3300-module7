        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          According to Pew Research, 96% of adults between 18-29 occasionally
          consult reviews before making a purchase. But does this mean that
          higher ratings result in more product sales? Specifically, what do
          higher ratings indicate for video game sales? Maybe higher ratings
          lead to more game sales. But could some more obscure games with a
          dedicated group of followers receive higher ratings than popular games
          with significant sales volume? I am also curious whether there has
          been an increase in the production of games in recent years and, if
          so, what effect this increase has on the quality of games based on
          review scores. Is it possible that an increase in the number of games
          results in review scores decreasing with the oversaturation of video
          game releases? In this project, I plan to use Metacritic’s user and
          critic review scores to see if there is a correlation between the
          scores of a game and its overall sales. I will be joining the review
          data with sales data obtained from VGChartz.

        <h2>2. Data</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Review Scores</h3>
        <p>
          I collected data from Metacritic, which contained user (user score)
          and critic (meta score) review scores for each game. Metacritic’s data
          was found on 186 different web pages. I wrote a web crawling script to
          collect all data across these 186 pages. I collected the game title,
          summary, platform, user score, meta score, and release date for 18,526
          games.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Sales Data</h3>
        <p>
          The website VGChartz provides sales data about the number of units of
          each game/platform combination sold. The information was contained in
          1,249 web pages. Due to the extensive nature of the data, I decided to
          break the web crawling results into six different CSV files
          (VGChartz_0 – 5.csv), all contained in the project folder.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Merging the Datasets</h3>
        <p>
          Since both data sets included the same game title multiple times based
          on the platform, I had to merge based on both the game title and
          platform. Both data sets are also vastly different in the number of
          observations.

        <h2>3. Analysis</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Video Game Ratings and Sales</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to find out whether games with higher reviews sell more and
          navigate the relationship between the different types of sales and
          review scores. I started by calculating correlation coefficients to
          explore the relationship between variables. There was a correlation
          coefficient of 0.954 between the total sales and North American sales,
          showing an extremely strong correlation. However, the correlation
          between sales and review scores was much weaker.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Video Game Publishers</h3>
        <p>
          To find out which video game publishers have the highest sales, I
          created a summary data frame, `publisher_df`, which was grouped by the
          publisher. In this data frame, I included the ratings’ average, the
          sum of sales, and the number of games each publisher has released.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Release Date</h3>
        <p>
          I analyzed how sales, the number of games released, and review scores
          have changed over time. The correlation coefficient between the
          release date and the number of games released was 0.533, showing some
          correlation, but not a particularly strong one.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, I analyzed three aspects of video game sales: the
          publisher, the release date, and how a game’s sales and review scores
          influence each other. Below is a summary of the key findings:
        </p>

        <h3>4.1 Correlation Between Review Scores and Sales</h3>
        <p>
          There is limited correlation between review scores and sales. However,
          while the relationship is not very strong, the meta score appears to
          be a better predictor of sales than the user score.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Trends in Video Game Sales Over Time</h3>
        <p>
          There is some correlation between the release date and the number of
          games released, but it is not particularly strong. The number of games
          released peaked around 2010 but has since declined.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Top Video Game Publishers</h3>
        <p>
          The top ten publishers are listed in Table 3. The same publishers
          appear in both total sales and North American sales rankings, but in
          different orders. Nintendo leads with 1.9 billion games sold, followed
          by Activision with 727 million units. North American sales account for
          40–60% of total sales, making the region a significant contributor to
          game publishers' success.
        </p>

        <h3>4.4 Console Influence on Ratings</h3>
        <p>
          The relationship between the console a game is released on and its
          ratings could not be analyzed due to missing data. Future work could
          explore this question by incorporating additional sources.
        </p>

        <h3>4.5 Limitations and Future Work</h3>
        <p>
          This project has several limitations, including missing review scores
          for games released before the mid-90s, inaccurate release dates for
          some games, and the absence of data on video game consoles. Future
          research could expand the dataset, analyze trends in video game
          console purchases, and examine whether more time between game releases
          results in higher sales and review scores.
